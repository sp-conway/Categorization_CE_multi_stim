        <b>Researcher:</b> Andrew L. Cohen

        <b>Location:</b> University of Massachusetts Amherst
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Introduction:</b> This form is called a Consent Form. It will give you information about the study so you can make a
decision about participation in this research. A copy of this form is also available upon request.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Purpose:</b> The purpose of this research study is to explore how people make judgments and choices.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Eligibility:</b> You must be at least 18 years old, fluent in English, have normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and be currently in
the United States to participate.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Procedures:</b> You will be seated in front of a computer. On each trial you will be shown a single option or a set of
options. You will be asked to either evaluate the options, select between the options, or group the options. The options may be
represented by numbers, words, and/or pictures. You may also be asked general questions about the options, your decision, or
you.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Study length:</b> The study will take place during a single session. The session will last approximately 60 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Benefits:</b> You may not directly benefit from this research; however, we hope that your participation in the study will
increase our understanding of human choice behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Compensation:</b> You will receive two SONA course credits
for participation. If you leave the experiment before completion, you will receive 1 SONA credit for each completed 30
minutes up to the maximum number of credits. If you are earning experimental credits through your participation, please
understand that this study is not the only way to do so - you may contact your instructor who will offer you an
appropriate alternative.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Risk:</b> There is always a slight risk of a breach of confidentiality (also see the “protection of personal information” section).
We believe there are no other known risks associated with this research study beyond those of using a computer.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Protection of personal information:</b> We will not collect any information that can be used to identify you. Your data will be
associated with a code. There will be no record linking the data to you. At the conclusion of this study, the researchers may
publish their findings or share the data with other researchers. You will not be identified in any publications or presentations.
      </p>
